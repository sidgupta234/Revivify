###About the project
REVIVIFY was built under **Code-N-Counter** Hackathon hosted by, **Nagarro**. PN is the solution to the problem faced by the visually impaired people in order to get access to education.
It is the cheapest, fastest and most efficient way for getting information, by interacting with the system through voice.

  `git clone https://github.com/sidgupta234/NagarroHackFinal/`
